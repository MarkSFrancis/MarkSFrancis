# MarkSFrancis
This is the home of the open source MarkSFrancis framework

## What is it?
MarkSFrancis is a framework designed to take common tasks, and simplify them into easy to use and implement code, from simplifying password hasing, to creating API clients.

The framework is split into multiple packages, which match the projects within this repository. 

## Compatibility & Dependancies
Projects within a Windows subdirectory have dependancies on the .NET Framework, and are therefore only compatible on Windows machines.

Projects within a Core subdirectory have dependancies on .NET Core (or ASP.NET Core).

All other projects use .NET Standard, and are therefore compatible with all sources.
